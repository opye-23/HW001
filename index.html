    Perhaps the key to getting the best out of Mohamed Salah is to drop him. Omitted then unleashed, the Egyptian warmed up for Manchester City with the fastest treble in Champions League history.

In six minutes and 12 seconds of magical mayhem, Salah served a reminder of his brilliance. Rangers may consider themselves unfortunate to have faced him at his rapacious, rampant best, but a game in which Liverpool trailed ended up as a rout, Salah coming off the bench to seal their belated first away win of the season in spectacular style.

Perhaps it added to the oddity of a team who have now won 9-0 and 7-1 this season while otherwise floundering. They went from struggling to superb in a six-goal second half as Rangers equalled their heaviest European defeat.
